<h1 align="center"> # Mapping-ESG-Risk-Rating </h1>

<h3 align="center"> This project maps the distribution of ESG Risk Ratings among companies where Emory alumni land as their first destinations </h3>

### Project Description: 
Businesses and society are interconnected, and one way they are linked is through the impact of societal factors on business risks. In this project, I aim to analyze a measurable risk influenced by Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors in the corporate world, known as the ESG risk rating. Morningstar Sustainalytics offers extensive coverage of analyst-based ESG Risk Ratings, making it a valuable data source. While the goal was to compare ESG risk ratings across all sectors, the data was limited to the consulting services sector. Consequently, the focus shifted to the financial services sector, which is the destination for the largest percentage of Emory graduates (36.2%). 

### Dataset:

The ESG Risk Rating scores are available from [here](https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-data). I used ESG Risk values, ESG Level, ESG Exposure, and ESG management values. 


### Results & Conclusion :

Within the financial sector, the analysis primarily concentrates on the top nine companies where students commonly secure positions. The ESG risk scores obtained from Sustainalytics are used for this comparison. ESG risk scores assess the level of risk associated with ESG factors, considering factors like risk level, exposure level, and management level. The objective of evaluating ESG risk scores is to encourage companies to manage ESG risks effectively and hold them accountable for promoting a sustainable economy. Hence, it is essential for companies to establish long-term goals aimed at reducing ESG risk and moving closer to a score of zero.

The bar graph is color coded in terms of ESG risk rating (lighter color means lower risk, darker means greater risk). 

In order to foster a stronger connection between "business and society," it's crucial for Emory to not only report the number of placements but also to incorporate metrics for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting. This added dimension of measurement is essential for promoting a more holistic understanding of the impact of business activities on society and the environment.
